                <p>Working with a managed security-services provider (MSSP) to co-manage your company’s security information and event management can be a better solution than doing it alone. When you have a co-managed or “hybrid SIEM” arrangement, it offers increased visibility into a company’s secure environment. It also leverages the financial and staffing investments already in place to buy and operate a SIEM. Join Proficio’s Managing Director of Asia, Alex Tok to learn more about the very latest best practices in hybrid SIEM strategy.</p>
